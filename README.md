 Steam to Origin launcher

# What it does
Lets you launch origin games from steam to be able to use steam features such as the overlay or a steam controller.  
Closes origin once the game closes.

# How to use
Download the originlauncher.exe under releases and add it to Steam as a non-steam game.  
Right-click on the newly added entry and go to properties.  
click "set launch options".  
In the textbox that appears first add the filename of the game you want to launch (ex: NeedForSpeedHeat.exe).  
then add the filepath to that exe wrapped in quotes (ex: "C:\Origin\games\Need For Speed Heat") make sure you do NOT add a backslash at the end of the filepath.  
(OPTIONAL) change the icon and name of the steam entry on the main properties page.
